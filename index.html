    <p>I am not sure what is required to be in "index" file, so i wrote like a simple reference for the pages of the
        assignment..
        it is already interative just in a simple way and the buttons/links are clickable.
        in the purchase page i juust provided a one example of one of books that can be purchased as i know that there
        are much
        simpler way to create just one interactive model for al books through express.js or whatever so, i gave just one
        example of the required books
